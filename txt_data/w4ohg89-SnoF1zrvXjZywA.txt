Love everything about this place. It's in the lobby of the ace hotel and has upscale decor and food. I came here in the fall and sat outside by the fire...Menu for those who doesn't eat, AND afraid of seafood. Outdated online menu!

Half TAGLIATELLE with housemade pasta has great flavors with 1 shrimp that...Beautiful, low key spot in the Fulton market area. Black leather interior on both lounging couches and bar stools, and you can easily hear your friends...
