Precision soba, served with care.

Popped into Azuma right as they opened on a Saturday at noon, and shouldn't have been surprised that it filled up pretty...A lot of choices on the menu, which can be overwhelming. We got seated right away as walk-ins on a Sat evening. The various combo boxes looked attractive...Nothing more refreshing than cold soba on the first day New York gets muggy! Brought here by friends who're frequents and I see how you easily get addicted...
