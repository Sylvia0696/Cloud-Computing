Came in for a quick rest stop and dined at the bar. Had the crab appetizer on the dinner menu. 

It was delicate, light, and well balanced in texture.Three stars because the portions are minuscule. It's an absurdity. Nouveau cuisine went out in the 80's and need not return. 

Service is nearly perfect. If...the food is delicious, the wine selection is excellent and the service isn't terrible, but I'm giving such a low-star rating because the portions are so...
