Came here for a birthday brunch last weekend. Super cute place. They accommodated a party of 7 for us and there were several large parties there I think...Their service is excellent, the food is terrific--mainly their arroz con pollo, their drinks are very good. I regularly visit Toloache to unwind after long...First visit to the downtown Toloache and it was quite enjoyable. Had a delicious cocktail at the bar before dinner and were seated in their small dinning...
