so so good, right by my office which is super convenient. i wish there was more of a "create your own" option but the veggie option they have available is...The Crunch (Sushi Burrito)

First time trying this. Wasn't anything impressive or flavorful for that matter. I'd much rather have regular sushi. It's pretty...Nothing like your SF Sushirrito (ugh I miss it) but a reasonable substitute. Pricing should be expected from this location, honestly.
