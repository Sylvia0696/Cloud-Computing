This is my first time here and I had the best burrito in my life, and that includes Mexico! Fresh homemade ingredients , so good I had to finish. 
I will go...Care to experience some of the freshest tortillas in the game? Look no further than La Palma. Nestled on the corner of 24th and Florida, this little tienda...Always the right choice when you find yourself hungry on 124th St. They excel in huaraches, freshly made with the proper corny flavor accented with lime....
