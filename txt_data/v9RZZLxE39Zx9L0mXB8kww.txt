This is definitely the BEST shabu I've had thus far! Mind you, this is coming from someone who's tried many shabu restaurants including ones in Japan...I have not been here for 5 years and sadly to say, it isnt my fav shabu place anymore. 

The rice is mushy and watery now, it used to be perfectly cooked....Still the best shabu in all 88 cities of Greater Los Angeles.

**Secret of beating the crowd: put your name on the waitlist at least 30min before opening....
