Very friendly and relaxing environment - staff, ambiance, patrons.  They know my order and are welcoming. Great food and drinks.Cute little cafe for your coffee and bagel needs. Cozy spot to relax for a while. Good service.Stopped by for a quick morning coffee to start my day. Nice quaint little spot. Looks like a good place if you want to study because it was quiet and cozy....
