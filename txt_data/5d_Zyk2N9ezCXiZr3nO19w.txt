Right outside the 6 train is the cutest restaurant. I love the authentic Latin American dishes and drinks. The passion fruit juice was so sweet! The chicken...Worst service ever! Placed an order at 3:30pm.. it's now 5:23 pm and I have no food. I called to complain about where my order is and the lady just told me...Me and my wife went here to try this place out for lunch. We sat in the bar area and kept asking the waitress for the menu. She didn't responded at all...
