New restaurant in the neighborhood!! Really awesome quick Latin inspired dishes. Stopped in on my way home and had the carne asada with rice and beans....Ordered a lunch with rice, black beans, chicken, and maduros. Everything was stale especially the maduros. Had to throw them away because they tasted so...Placed an order online. They never processed it and did not answer the phone when I called the restaurant
