Delicious mouth-watering experience. Cool counter spot that's connected to two other floors - a speakeasy in the basement and an izakaya on the first floor....omg...you must go here! 
the freshest fish, just like Tokyo!
Food is insanely amazing. But the service was exceptional. We were greeted by the GM (Ken?) and...Omakase review. I've been to dinner at the omakase bar upstairs twice. Both times have been pretty exceptional. 

SETTING: came with my friends for dinner...
