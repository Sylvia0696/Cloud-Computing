This review is about my delivery experience Rai Rai Ken

I have ordered from this restaurant a few times during my short tenure in Harlem. On each occasion,...This is based off delivery, so I can't speak for dining in. Maybe they're just one of those places to dine in at. 

It was very mediocre. Everything was...Very good ramen in here! I order shoyu ramen and menma they have happy hour Sapporo only 3$ that's fantastic! And dessert mochi ice cream  so good yummy!!!
