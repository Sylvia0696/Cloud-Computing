Quite simply put- the best experience I have ever had with a soup delivery.

I have been battling a cold for literally a month now and the most persistent...I ordered vegetarian pho and the lemongrass tofu sandwich. The sandwich was large and super delicious. The bread was a little softer than I'd prefer but I'm...Dry chicken, nearly unpalatable.
Literally didn't finish the meal.
I hope I don't get food poisoning.
