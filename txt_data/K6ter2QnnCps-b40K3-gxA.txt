Service: 10/10
Nice lady who works here helped me out since it was my first time and I just appreciated here attitude so much, she was so happy so serve me!...No they were not willing to serve customers at 8:48pm.  The closed sign was already up.  They decided to take my order, so I waited while they were bringing...Price is fair, but food has no taste.

Service was good.

Not sure if I would come back.
